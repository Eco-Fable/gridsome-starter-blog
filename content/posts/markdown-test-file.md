Earlier this year, before COVID lockdowns and social distancing became the norm, a family member was attending a Society for Women Engineers event. The attendees included a few engineering students, as well as a recruiter from a major company. This family member, a civil engineer by training and now a project manager, said that this recruiter told the students she hardly, if ever, reads cover letters that are submitted in job applications. As someone who devotes hours to perfecting my letters, agonizing over word choice and sentence composition, this was not easy for me to hear. Quite frankly, it infuriated me. What really hit me though was her follow-up comment. When my family member asked this recruiter whether cover letters could provide insight into not just the applicant’s prior work experience but also their writing skills, this woman responded by saying, “Engineers don’t really need to know how to write.”

I’m sorry, what?
 
I was, and still am, shocked to hear this in 2020. I realize that for many I’m stating the obvious when I say that every profession requires writing in some capacity, including those in the STEM fields. This includes engineers, doctors, programmers, and scientists. The idea that someone would tell young professionals otherwise, to wave off writing like it’s something unessential, irks me. Especially when the person spewing this advice is in a position of authority with the power to decide whether young professionals like myself land a job. I was glad to hear many of the professional engineers at the event fought back against this comment, and insisted to this recruiter that she was incorrect.  
 
Good writing is not something that should be saved strictly for novels, or only taken seriously by high-brow English professors in their university offices. Writing is not something we suddenly stop caring about once we’ve turned in our last college essay before graduation. Almost all of the jobs I’ve applied to are in the STEM fields, and most if not all listed good written and oral communication skills under their requirements section. 

Good writing shows more than just whether someone knows how to put together a sentence. It sends a message to the reader that you took the time to compose a well-crafted response, and that you were thoughtful in conveying what you had to say. Not to mention that clear, articulate writing is also demonstrative of a higher level of professionalism. A manager probably wouldn’t look too kindly on a report handed in by one of their employees that’s littered with grammatical and spelling errors. They’re not going to read this report and consider their employee’s insights or perspectives. All they’re going to see is the employee’s mistakes. 

Writing and storytelling is an art that’s persevered regardless of society’s advances. We engage and forge social bonds through stories more easily than we do with just facts or research results. This has become increasingly more important for the STEM fields, especially at a time when science is being challenged by powerful officials on an almost daily basis. Researchers will always need to convey their work to the public in a way that is clear and easy to understand. Any progress in combatting climate change or COVID-19 means little if scientists can’t adequately share that knowledge with the rest of the population, or get that population to care.  

Now more than ever we’re using writing and storytelling to stay connected during social distancing. We’re writing to friends and family to let them know we’re thinking of them. We’re writing to share stories of bravery, hope, as well as report disparities in aid or medical response that need to be addressed. People are sharing their traumatic experiences of having the virus. Others are using writing as an outlet for their fears and anxieties, reminding readers to be mindful of their mental health as well as their physical health.     

I’m not saying we all need to go out and get English degrees. Nor am I saying we need to learn to write like J.R.R. Tolkien or Shakespeare (I mean, you could, but I can’t promise your manager would fully appreciate it). But all professionals, both young and old, should continue to be mindful in how we craft our messages to others. You don’t have to be a perfect writer in order to write (I’m certainly not, and I’m doing it right now). Your words could change someone’s life, or provide a message that someone desperately needed to read. Make the effort to show your reader that they matter.   

But seriously, maybe leave the Shakespearean-style of writing out of your manager’s inbox.
