Earlier this year, before COVID lockdowns became the norm, a family member had helped to organize a career event for engineering students. 
One of the invited guests worked as a recruiter in human resources for a major company. 
This family member, a civil engineer by training and now a project manager, told me afterward that this guest told students she hardly, if ever, reads cover letters that are submitted in job applications. As someone who devotes hours to perfecting my letters, agonizing over word choice and sentence composition, this was not easy for me to hear. Quite frankly, it infuriated me. What really hit me though was her follow-up comment. When my family member asked this guest whether cover letters could provide insight into not just the applicant’s prior work experience but also their writing skills, this woman responded with, “Engineers don’t really need to know how to write.”

I’m sorry, what?
 
I was, and still am, shocked to hear this in 2020. Every profession requires writing in some capacity, including those in the STEM fields, and the idea that someone would tell young professionals otherwise angers me. I was glad to hear many of the engineering students attending the event fought back against this comment, and insisted to this recruiter that she was incorrect. 
 
Good writing is not something that should be saved strictly for novels, or only taken seriously by high-brow English professors in their university offices. Writing is not something we suddenly stop caring about once we’ve turned in our last college essay before graduating. Good writing shows more than just whether or not someone knows how to put together a sentence. It sends a message to the reader that you took the time to compose a well-crafted response, and that you were thoughtful in conveying what you had to say. 

Not to mention that clear, articulate writing is also demonstrative of a higher level of professionalism. A manager probably wouldn’t look too kindly on a report handed in by one of their engineers that’s littered with grammatical and spelling errors. I highly doubt the manager would let this employee get away with it just because they didn’t study English in college. This manager isn’t going to read this report and consider their employee’s insights or perspectives. All they’re going to see is the employee’s mistakes. 

Writing has persevered regardless of our advances in technology. Communities are built on our ability for storytelling. It enables us to learn and relate to one another, while also sharing valuable information. We engage with each one other through stories more easily than we can do with just facts or research results.This has become increasingly more important for the STEM field, especially at a time when science is being challenged by powerful officials on an almost daily basis. Researchers will always need to convey their work to the public in a way that is clear and easy to understand. Any progress in combatting climate change or COVID-19 means little if scientists can’t not only adequately share that knowledge with the rest of the population, but also get that population to care.  

Now more than ever we’re using writing and storytelling to stay connected. We’re writing to friends and family to let them know we’re thinking of them. We’re writing to share stories of bravery, hope, as well as tales of disparities (singular?) in aid or medical response that need to be addressed. People are recording their scary or traumatic experiences of having the virus, and encouraging them to stay safe.  

I’m not saying we all need to go out and get English degrees. Nor am I saying we need to learn to write like J.R.R. Tolkien or Shakespeare (I mean, you could, but I can’t promise your manager would fully appreciate it). All I’m saying is that professionals, both young and old, should all continue to be mindful in how we craft our messages to others. You don’t have to be a perfect writer in order to write (I’m certainly not, and I’m doing it right now). Just continue to make the effort and show your reader that what you write is as important as what you have to say. 

But seriously, maybe leave the Shakespearean-style of writing out of your manager’s inbox.
